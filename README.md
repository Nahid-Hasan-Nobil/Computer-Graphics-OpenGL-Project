# Computer-Graphics-OpenGL-Project
#Visualizing Dynamic Landscapes
Project Overview:
Interactive graphical applications provide a fascinating way to simulate real-world environments and processes. This project, developed using the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT), features three distinct interactive scenarios that offer a captivating visual experience:
1.	London Bridge Scene
2.	Snow Mountain Scene
3.	Sky Mountain Scene
This project emphasizes smooth transitions, dynamic animations, and realistic graphical representations. By clicking specific buttons, users can navigate through the scenarios, observing and interacting with the visual elements in a seamless and immersive manner.
Scenario Descriptions
1.	London Bridge Scene: The first scenario depicts London Bridge in an evening setting, complete with dynamic lighting effects to simulate the city’s ambience. Key elements include moving vehicles, pedestrians crossing the bridge, boats gliding across the Thames, and reflections of the city lights in the water.
2.	Snow Mountain Scene: This scenario transports users to a serene mountain range blanketed in snow. It features animated snowfall, a flowing river partially frozen by the cold, and wildlife such as deer and birds moving through the environment. The interplay of light and shadows creates a realistic winter atmosphere.
3.	Sky Mountain Scene: The final scene presents a breathtaking mountain view against a sky backdrop. Dynamic elements such as floating clouds, a glowing sun, and birds soaring across the horizon enhance the immersive experience. The mountains’ textures and the vivid sky colors emphasize the beauty of nature.
